const accountId = 144553 //cannot be changed once assigned

//let and var both can be used to declare 
//variable but let is used mostly because 
//of scope problem
let accountEmail = "abhioshek@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
let accountState; //js consider it as undefined

accountCity = "jaipur" //this is also a way to declare variable but not right way

//to print a variable
console.log(accountId);

//can print all variable in a tabular form
console.table([accountId, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity])
